# 🚄 Railway Data Engineering and Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Indian railway operational data using data engineering techniques. The goal is to explore, clean, transform, and analyze train schedule data to uncover meaningful insights, identify patterns in train operations, and present the findings using visualizations and a final report.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Load and inspect the railway dataset
* Clean and standardize data (e.g., station names, missing values)
* Filter and group data based on custom conditions
* Analyze trends in train operations across days and stations
* Visualize findings using Python libraries
* Compile a detailed, stakeholder-ready report

---

## 📁 Dataset

* **File Name:** `Railway_info.csv`
* **Contents:** Train number, name, source station, destination station, days of operation (Mon-Sun)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* Data cleaning and formatting
* Train frequency analysis by source station
